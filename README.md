Try Your Luck Game App

The app is about, the number of tries before winning, or matching 3 or more numbers
in a lottery game. Will it increase the chances if the user buys different games and
use the same Quick pick numbers for 7 days? Some games will have drawings every
day and others 3 or 2 drawings only in the seven days.

The computer will repeat this process for the number of years provided by the user, and
will print out the results.

The users will have the option to pick from different games, play one, or multiple games at the same time.
E.g. (games in Minnesota)
1. Powerball
  5 numbers out of 1-69 *
  1 number out of 1-26*
2. Northstar cash
  1 number out of 1-32*
And so on.
The computer will pick the numbers for the users.

   *GAME
    Select one or more games, select one a time, the computer will ask if more are needed to be added.
    Number of years; enter a number of years (int) that one wants to play.

    Configure number of drawings in one year(numbOfDrawingInOneYear * years). e. g. Northstar plays everyday(365*years), were the Power-ball is twice a week(2*52weeks*years).

    Your numbers; Every week(7 days) the computer will do a quick pick for each game selected(new set of numbers for each game) that is good for 7 days and depending of the game’s drawing rules, some might just do one drawing a week(7 days) others every day. Check the website e.g. www.mnlottery.com for basic rules.
    The computer will randomly select a set of numbers for each drawing. (from game’s list of numbers) e.g. northstar(drawing (list = 5 numbers out of 1-31) will draw 7times.

    Match the above numbers to the drawings (random numbers)
    Store matched numbers in a new list for each drawing.

    We only need/want the matches that have 3 or more numbers in it(winners only).
    Add the winning matches to a counter, an option is to check if the matched numbers list has 3, 4, 5, or 6 matching numbers.

    Display how many times each of the matches occurred in the number of years played. Optional(display the numbers(sets) with the drawing numbers and the matching numbers when you won with 3 numbers or more). E.g. >> 30 times matched 3 numbers. >> 4 times matched 4 numbers
